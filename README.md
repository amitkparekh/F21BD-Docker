# F21BD â€” Running things using Docker

Installing dependencies and making things work can be annoying. Docker can make this much easier!
This repository can make for running and using the different databases _much_ easier!

<!-- ## Table of Contents -->

```

## Running things

This repository has one `docker-compose.yaml` file which can run everything you need for the course. Below are how to run and access each one.

### Jena-Fuseki

1. Run `docker-compose up jena-fuseki`

You should be able to access the Web UI from `localhost:3030` as normal.

#### Notes

- The default password for the admin user is `admin`.
- Data persists across runs

### Neo4J

1. Run `docker-compose up neo4j`

The default username is `neo4j` and the default password is `graphdb`.
